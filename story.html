A stream lay amid a woodland. In this specific spot, many stones were strewn about, over which the water roared and whitened. The stream’s mouth began a mile from this location. It ended in the town of Salem. The bank was fecund as to foster lofty oaks and birches. Such trees sheltered the stream from the sun and housed many breeds of birds.

</p> <p>
There existed a small village nested within the bowels of olden Massachusetts alongside this stream named Pillarage. A few cottages were sprinkled about. This village did not possess neither a church nor a town hall. Such a town was owned by the populace. There were 4 cottages in exact.
</p> <p>
The first cottage belonged to the Tellman family - who were of French origin. It had two floors, one hearth, four lattice windows, eight green shutters, two doors, and one clay roof, and a red barn containing cows and horses. The second one was the same as the former, yet it had half the floors, windows, and shutters, and no barn - all else was the same. The third and fourth were the same as the second - except that the second one belonged to the Calf family, the fourth one belonged to the Wood family, and the last belonged to the Willowtraught. A plus-shaped pathway connected all four houses amid which was a spring from which water could be drawn. In total, there were twenty persons in this village. The land past the stream and village teemed with knolls, green and sparsely treed. Ten years passed.

A boy from the Tellman family grew up. He breathed by the name of Thom - Thom Tellman. The village soon fell into disrepair - a great fire had vested the city in an ardent blaze. Whence it began, there are none who know. The population was half of what it was ten years ago. There were no schools, and therefore his education was of his own make. In order to restore plenty and unity to this town, he established Factory Deux alongside the bank. Keep in mind that the year was 1835, and that Thom had arose from the embryo 20 years ago. Factory Deux was a mighty vessel of steel who belched out smoke by the gallon. Such a fact dismayed the residents, who rejoiced in the somber beauty of the environs. “Business must continue,” said he gravely. Albeit this Pillarage flourished. Thus, the population leaped up to 750.

The year was 1837, and at this epoch it was Spring. Sap was in the bough, honey was dripping from the comb, birds were singing their merry tune. Factory Deux annexed more land in every direction. The sky grew nebulous with smoke; the air grew foul, the bird fled, the trees perished. “Business must continue.” That was the line of speech that Tellman reassured himself with.

The year was 1850, and Thom Tellman had found something the likes of which could not have been found elsewhere. He had reached the earth’s core with his mechanical arm. The treasure he named Godmatter, for it emitted a golden hue. He crafted out of it a pickaxe. When he touched it by chance, it shot an immediate spike of poison throughout his body, and he soon expired. Godmatter is known now by another name: Tellman’s bane. Factory Deux fell into dilapidation, and so did the city once again. The holes and crevasses were filled in with the dust of time; the walls of Factory Deux came crashing down. The tale of Thom Tellman dwindled into legend, then nothingness. That is, unto a boy grew up hereafter Thom and fell into a similar greed, a similar fate. And alas, the cycle repeated incessantly. Luckily, no word spread of this “Godmatter.” Every owner discovered it anew, and they thus perished.
